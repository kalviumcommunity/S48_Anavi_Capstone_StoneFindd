# StoneFind

Introduction:
This project aims to create a web application that displays the inventory of local stone and tile sellers. The platform will enable users to explore product options, check stock availability, and get in touch with nearby businesses directly for inquiries.

How would I like to improve the world?
In the current era, renovation and construction projects often become a source of frustration for both homeowners and contractors due to inefficiencies in the building materials supply chain. Finding the right stone and tile options can be a time-consuming and opaque process, which can add to the frustration. However, if there was a more connected and efficient marketplace for these materials, it would significantly improve the experience for everyone involved.

Why is this a problem?
Many buyers tend to miss out on the variety of stone and tile products offered by local sellers because they rely on word-of-mouth recommendations or generic online searches. Obtaining real-time stock information is often a challenge, and buyers may end up visiting stores that don't have the specific product they need. Additionally, contacting multiple sellers for quotes and inquiries can be a cumbersome process, which can slow down project timelines.

Solution
The solution is a user-friendly web application designed to facilitate the buying process of stone and tile products from local sellers. It offers a convenient and efficient platform for buyers to browse from a wide range of products, while also providing a marketplace for local sellers to showcase their inventory. The application ensures a seamless shopping experience for buyers, with features such as easy navigation, clear product descriptions, and secure payment options. By bridging the gap between buyers and local sellers, the solution aims to boost the local economy and support small businesses.

Technical solutions
Front-end development framework (React): Develop an interface that is user-friendly and visually appealing. The interface should allow users to browse products, search by category or filter, and view seller information.

Back-end development framework (Node.js): Develop a system that handles data processing, user authentication, communication between buyers and sellers, and real-time inventory updates.

Database management system: Develop a system that stores product details, including high-quality pictures, seller information, user accounts, and stock levels.

Mapping API integration: Integrate a mapping API to enable location-based search functionalities. This will allow buyers to find nearby sellers and filter results geographically.
